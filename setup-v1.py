# Generate a Docker script to create a simple linux machine that has python 3.10 (prebuilt) installed with following libraries: pandas, tensorflow, numpy
# Here's a Docker script to create a simple Linux machine with Python 3.10 and the requested libraries:

Dockerfile:

# Base image
FROM python:3.10-slim

# Install dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    libpq-dev \
    gcc

# Install Python libraries
RUN pip install pandas tensorflow numpy
Use code with caution.
Dockerfile
Explanation:

Base image: This Dockerfile uses the official python:3.10-slim image as a base, which provides a minimal Linux environment with Python 3.10 pre-installed.
Install dependencies:
libpq-dev: This package is required for building psycopg2, which might be needed by pandas for certain functionalities.
gcc: This is needed for compiling some Python libraries.
Install Python libraries: This line uses pip to install the required libraries: pandas, tensorflow, and numpy.
Building and Running the Image:

Save the Dockerfile as Dockerfile in your project directory.
Build the Docker image:
docker build -t my-python-image .
Use code with caution.
Bash
Run the image:
docker run -it my-python-image
Use code with caution.
Bash
This will create a container from the image and give you an interactive shell. You can then verify that Python and the libraries are installed correctly.
